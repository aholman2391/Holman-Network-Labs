## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Alin Holman**, an IT enthusiast transitioning from the transport industry into technology.  
This repository documents my hands-on networking labs, created to strengthen practical skills and demonstrate my progression toward **networking, infrastructure, and cloud-based roles**.

👉 **I focus on learning by doing** — these labs represent real, practical experience gained through configuring and troubleshooting networks in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, simulating real-world on-premise environments commonly integrated with cloud platforms.

My long-term goal is to work in **network engineering, infrastructure, or cloud support roles**, where strong networking fundamentals are essential.

---

## 🎯 Current Direction

📚 Studying **CompTIA Network+**  
☁️ Building foundations for **AWS & Microsoft Azure networking**  
🧠 Strengthening skills in routing, switching, subnetting, and troubleshooting  
🔗 Learning how on-premise networks integrate with cloud environments

# 🖥️ Basic Network Configuration ![Lab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lab-Networking%20%26%20Cloud-blue)

**Topology:** 4 PCs | 2 Switches | 1 Router  
**Environment:** Cisco Packet Tracer  
**Lab Type:** Networking Fundamentals  

---

## 🎯 Lab Goal

Build a small network and achieve **full end-to-end connectivity** between all devices.

---

## 🛠️ Key Actions

- Deployed 4 PCs, 2 switches, and 1 router
- Connected PCs to switches using copper straight-through cables
- Connected switches to the router via Gigabit Ethernet interfaces
- Configured router interfaces:
  - Assigned IP addresses (192.168.1.1/24)
  - Enabled interfaces using `no shutdown`
- Configured PCs with IP addresses within the same subnet
- Verified connectivity using `ping` tests between all hosts

---

## ✅ Result

The network is fully operational, and all PCs can successfully communicate with each other.

This lab reinforces **core networking concepts** that directly apply to enterprise and cloud networking environments.
