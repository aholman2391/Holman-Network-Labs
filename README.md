## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Alin Holman**, an IT enthusiast transitioning from the transport industry into technology.

This repository documents hands-on networking labs designed to strengthen practical skills and demonstrate my progression toward **infrastructure, networking, and cloud-focused roles**.

These labs follow a *learning-by-doing* approach and were completed using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, simulating real-world on-premise environments commonly integrated with cloud platforms.

# Basic Network Configuration  
**4 PCs | 2 Switches | 1 Router**

**Environment:** Cisco Packet Tracer  
**Lab Type:** Networking Fundamentals

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a small network and enable full end-to-end connectivity between all devices.

---

## 🛠️ Key Actions

- Deployed 4 PCs, 2 switches, and 1 router
- Connected PCs to switches using copper straight-through cables
- Connected switches to the router using Gigabit Ethernet interfaces
- Configured router interfaces:
  - Assigned IP addresses (192.168.1.1/24)
  - Enabled interfaces using `no shutdown`
- Assigned IP addresses to PCs within the same subnet

---

## ✅ Result

The network is fully operational, and all PCs can successfully communicate with each other.

This lab demonstrates core networking concepts that form the foundation for **enterprise and cloud networking environments**.
