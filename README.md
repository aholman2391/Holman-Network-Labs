## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Alin Holman**, an IT enthusiast transitioning from the transport industry into technology.  
I created this repository to document hands-on networking experience, strengthen my practical skills, and demonstrate my commitment to moving into infrastructure and networking roles.





👉 **I focus on learning by doing — these labs represent the practical experience I’ve gained while developing the skills needed for a career in IT, and were completed in Packet Tracer virtual network environments, simulating real-world IT scenarios.**
