Holman Network Labs








👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Alin Holman, an IT enthusiast transitioning from the transport industry into technology.
I created this repository to document hands-on networking experience, strengthen my practical skills, and demonstrate my commitment to moving into infrastructure and networking roles.

👉 I focus on learning by doing — these labs represent the practical experience I’ve gained while developing the skills needed for a career in IT, and were completed in Packet Tracer virtual network environments, simulating real-world IT scenarios.

🎯 Current Direction

✅ CompTIA A+ Certified
📚 Currently studying CompTIA Network+
🧠 Building strong foundations in switching, routing, and IP networking
☁️ Next target: Microsoft Azure (AZ-900 → AZ-104)

🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

IP Addressing & Subnetting

Device Configuration (PCs, Switches, Routers)

VLAN Configuration & Inter-VLAN Routing

DHCP & NAT

Network Connectivity Testing (ping, tracert)

Troubleshooting Network Issues

💻 Hands-On Lab Portfolio
🖥️ Lab 1 — Basic Network: 4 PCs, 2 Switches, 1 Router

Objective: Build a small network and enable full connectivity.

Steps Taken:

Added 4 PCs, 2 switches, and 1 router in Packet Tracer

Connected PCs to switches using copper straight-through cables

Connected switches to router using Gigabit Ethernet ports

Configured router interfaces:

Assigned IP addresses and subnet masks

Enabled interfaces with no shutdown

Configured PCs with IP addresses in the same subnet

Verified connectivity using ping

✅ Result: PCs can communicate; network is fully functional.
