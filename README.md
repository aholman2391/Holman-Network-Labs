## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Alin Holman**, an IT enthusiast transitioning from the transport industry into technology.  

I created this repository to document hands-on networking experience, strengthen my practical skills, and demonstrate my commitment to moving into **infrastructure and networking roles**.

<br>

👉 **I focus on learning by doing** — these labs represent practical experience gained while developing real-world IT skills.  
All labs were completed using **Cisco Packet Tracer** virtual network environments.

## 🎯 Goal

🧠 Design and configure a small network to achieve **full end-to-end connectivity** between all PCs using Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## 🛠️ Key Actions

🔌 **Network Deployment**
- Deployed **4 PCs**, **2 switches**, and **1 router**
- Connected PCs to switches using **copper straight-through cables**
- Connected switches to the router via **Gigabit Ethernet interfaces**

🧩 **Configuration**
- Configured router interfaces:
  - Assigned IP addresses (`192.168.1.1/24`)
  - Enabled interfaces using `no shutdown`
- Assigned IP addresses to all PCs within the same subnet

🧪 **Testing**
- Verified connectivity using `ping` between all PCs

---

## ✅ Result

🟢 **Success!**  
The network is fully operational, and all PCs can communicate with each other without packet loss.
