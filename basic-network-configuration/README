# Basic Network Configuration Lab

![Lab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lab-Networking%20%26%20Cloud-blue)

**Topology:** 4 PCs | 2 Switches | 1 Router  
**Environment:** Cisco Packet Tracer  
**Lab Type:** Networking Fundamentals  

---

## 🎯 Lab Goal

Build a small network and enable **full end-to-end connectivity** between all PCs.

---

## 🛠️ Key Actions

1. **Network Deployment**
   - Added 4 PCs, 2 switches, and 1 router
   - Connected PCs to switches using copper straight-through cables
   - Connected switches to the router using Gigabit Ethernet interfaces

2. **Router Configuration**
   - Assigned IP addresses to interfaces (192.168.1.1/24, etc.)
   - Enabled interfaces with `no shutdown`

3. **PC Configuration**
   - Assigned IP addresses in the same subnet as the router
   - Configured default gateways as needed

4. **Connectivity Testing**
   - Verified end-to-end connectivity between all PCs

---

## ✅ Result

- Full network connectivity achieved  
- All PCs can communicate with each other successfully  
- Network topology is functional and ready for more advanced configurations (VLANs, routing, etc.)

---
